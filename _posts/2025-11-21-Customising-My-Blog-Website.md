Well as you can understand from the URL, I created my blog website using GitHub Pages. 
To get started on creating my blog website using GitHub Pages, I followed a tutorial --> [skills/github-pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
It was good, for example I didn't know that it was using Jekyll as a website generator. I'm like an alien when it comes to creating websites and similar things. 
I do have a little sooooo little 🤏 knowledge about HTML and CSS. I didn't even mention JavaScript because I do not know (ಥ _ ಥ)
My coding journey started with Java and continued with MATLAB. After that, I started to learn Python by myself HOWEVER this is a topic for another post ( ﾉ ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ

I am using [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as a theme but I want to make some changes especially on the colour palette or scheme or whatever it is called. 
I wanna use Dracula colour scheme I just love it 🥰 yet I found that it is more challenging than I expected because I lack experience in HTML and CSS. 
Thus, this post will be my journal for the journey of customising my blog website (ofc I'll get help from AI 🙄)
